**Note:** This theme only modifies Zen Browser's outer interface. If you want to customize the settings pages and new tab to match your Zen Browser theme, you can download the `userContent.css` and Catppuccin Zen Logo from the [Zen-Browser Catppuccin Repository](https://github.com/IAmJafeth/zen-browser). Follow the steps listed there to apply these customizations.

Please be aware that themes downloaded from the GitHub repository will not change using the preferences setup in Zen Browser's Mod settings and must be managed manually.
